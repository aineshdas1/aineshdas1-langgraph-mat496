Introduction to LangGraph and Control Flow

What I Learned:
I learned that one language model alone is limited because it cannot use tools or handle many steps at once. To fix this, we use chains made of small steps before and after the model. A router agent follows fixed steps, while a fully autonomous agent decides everything on its own. LangGraph helps keep the system steady even when the model has more control.

What I Changed:
No major changes. I only explored how control flow and agents work in LangGraph.
