Module 1 Video 1 
Introduction to LangGraph and Control Flow

What I Learned:
I learned that one language model alone is limited because it cannot use tools or handle many steps at once. To fix this, we use chains made of small steps before and after the model. A router agent follows fixed steps, while a fully autonomous agent decides everything on its own. LangGraph helps keep the system steady even when the model has more control.

What I Changed:
No major changes. I only explored how control flow and agents work in LangGraph.

What I Learned

In this lesson, I learned how to build a simple graph and understood the main parts of a LangGraph. I learned that normal edges connect nodes in order, while conditional edges connect nodes based on certain conditions. I also learned that the state is the object passed between nodes and edges in the graph.

What I Changed

I created a simple LangGraph that checks the weather. Based on the condition, it gives a response depending on whether the weather is good or bad.

What I learned:

I learned about LangGraph Studio, which is an interactive tool for building, viewing, and debugging AI agent workflows created with LangGraph. It works with LangSmith so we can trace, test, and optimize prompts or graph runs in real time. I also learned that each module has a studio directory to help run the LangGraph Studio for that module.

What I Changed:

Since there was no notebook for this video, I followed the tutorial, ran LangGraph Studio on my laptop, and tested a few graph states. It worked as expected
